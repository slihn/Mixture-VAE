## Overview
The Mixture-VAE framework is designed for the classification of financial regimes by leveraging a mixture-model in the latent space of variational autoencoders. This approach offers flexible and learnable distance measure for the classification models in a data-driven way.

---

## Features
- **Financial Regime Identification:**  
  Apply advanced VAE models to identify and classify financial market regimes.
- **Synthetic Experiment Reproduction:**  
  Detailed notebooks enable the reproduction of synthetic experiment results with hyper-parameter search.
- **Baseline Comparisons:**  
  Compare Mixture-VAE performance against baseline models such as HMM, K-Means, and jump models.
- **Modular Implementation:**  
  Clear separation of core components and wrappers for easy extension and maintenance.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
- **Example Notebook:**  
  Explore an end-to-end usage example with the `example_usage.ipynb` notebook.
- **Model Implementation:**  
  The key implementation is provided in `model/mixture_vae.py`. For batch fitting and inference, refer to the wrapper in `model/vae_module.py`.

---

## Experiments
To reproduce the experimental results, follow these steps:

- **Synthetic Experiments:**  
  Run the notebooks located in `exp_notebooks/synthetic_notebooks/mixture-vae` for synthetic experiment results with hyper-parameter searching.
